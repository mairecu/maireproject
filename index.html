            <p>HTML is the <b>language used for web pages</b>. It's made of <em>text content</em>, <em>markup</em>, <em>references</em> to other documents and <em>links</em> to other pages.</p>
            <p>The <b>markup</b>, which <em>defines how the content looks like</em>, has <b>tags</b>, <b>elements</b> and <b>attributes</b>. Those let us reflect what we really want to make out of our web page.</p>

          <div class="content">
            <p>In session 2 i've learned the first and more basic ways to create a <em>Structured document with <b>HTML</b></em>.</p>
            <p>First of all, it is important to remember the function of each component of the web page:</p>
            - <b>HTML</b>: <em>Structure</em><br>
            <br>
            - <b>CSS</b>: <em>Style</em><br>
            <br>
            - <b>JAVASCRIPT</b>: <em>Interactive components</em><br>
            <p><b>HTML</b> posses <em>syntax</em> and <em>rules</em>. This syntax contents <em>tags</em> that are organized in a <b>Tree like struture</b>. Each HTML tag creates an element in the <b>DOM</b> (<em>Document object model</em>) that the browser uses to display the page.</p>
            <p>All components within a web page desing is inside a <b>box</b>. This way is much easy to organized, move and detect every single detail that needs to be modify. This technique is known as <em>Boxify a Desing</em>.</p>

          <div class="number"><b>Session 3</b></div>
          <div class="content">
            <p>In this session i got to understand and work with <b>CSS</b> (<em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>). You can have several CSS files or sheet that wil be referenced in HTML and all of those are gonna be used to find out the final and visible style for your page.</p>
            <p>A very important concept to apply is the <b>Inheritance</b>, wichi is the <em>mechnism by wich properties are applied not only to a specified element, but also to its descendants</em>. Inheritance prevents certain properties for being declared over and over again in a style sheet, allowing the software developers to wirte less code. It enhances faster-loading of web pages by users and enables the client to save money on band width and development costs.</p>

                  -Background<br>
                  -Border<br>
                  -Display<br>
                  -Float and clear<br>
                  -Height and width<br>
                  -Margin<br>
                  -Min. and max. height and width<br>
                  -Outline<br>
                  -Overflow<br>
                  -Padding<br>
                  -Position<br>
                  -Text-decoration<br>
                  -Vertical-align<br>
                  -Z-index<br>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>In CSS we have what we call a selector. This defines what elements of the page a partiular style will apply to. You can use an HTML tag and that rule will apply to all that tag on the page.</p>
            <pre>
            (e.g. <b>p{

            }</b>)
            </pre>
            <p>Other way to do it is selecting elements by class. (e.g. <b>.description {<br>color: red;<br>}</b>)</p>
            <p>Codes can be complicated and very long, there's a way we can make it easy for the people who's going to be reading our code in the future. We can use <b>Code comments</b> (<em>Lines of text that computers ignores</em>).They are there so that programmers can leave notes for those other people (or themselves) to read.</p>
            <div class="Box sizing">
              <div class="box name"><b>Box sizing</b></div>
              <p>HTML are boxes and each box has four components. There are two techniques we can use to help deal with sizing issues:</p>
              <p>-Set sizes in terms of percent (%) rather than pixels.</p>
              <p>-Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="Box positioning">
              <div class="box name"><b>Box positioning</b></div>
              <p>Divs are blocks elements, so by default they take up the entire width of a page. Adding the rule <em>display-flex;</em> to the appropiate CSS will overrride this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.</p>
