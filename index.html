            <p>HTML is the <b>language used for web pages</b>. It's made of <em>text content</em>, <em>markup</em>, <em>references</em> to other documents and <em>links</em> to other pages.</p>
            <p>The <b>markup</b>, which <em>defines how the content looks like</em>, has <b>tags</b>, <b>elements</b> and <b>attributes</b>. Those let us reflect what we really want to make out of our web page.</p>

          <div class="content">
            <p>In session 2 i've learned the first and more basic ways to create a <em>Structured document with <b>HTML</b></em>.</p>
            <p>First of all, it is important to remember the function of each component of the web page:</p>
            - <b>HTML</b>: <em>Structure</em><br>
            <br>
            - <b>CSS</b>: <em>Style</em><br>
            <br>
            - <b>JAVASCRIPT</b>: <em>Interactive components</em><br>
            <p><b>HTML</b> posses <em>syntax</em> and <em>rules</em>. This syntax contents <em>tags</em> that are organized in a <b>Tree like struture</b>. Each HTML tag creates an element in the <b>DOM</b> (<em>Document object model</em>) that the browser uses to display the page.</p>
            <p>All components within a web page desing is inside a <b>box</b>. This way is much easy to organized, move and detect every single detail that needs to be modify. This technique is known as <em>Boxify a Desing</em>.</p>

          <div class="number"><b>Session 3 (Stage 1)</b></div>
          <div class="content">
            <p>In this session i got to understand and work with <b>CSS</b> (<em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>). You can have several CSS files or sheet that wil be referenced in HTML and all of those are gonna be used to find out the final and visible style for your page.</p>
            <p>A very important concept to apply is the <b>Inheritance</b>, wichi is the <em>mechnism by wich properties are applied not only to a specified element, but also to its descendants</em>. Inheritance prevents certain properties for being declared over and over again in a style sheet, allowing the software developers to wirte less code. It enhances faster-loading of web pages by users and enables the client to save money on band width and development costs.</p>

                  -Display<br>
                  -Float and clear<br>
                  -Height and width<br>
                  -Margin<br>
                  -Min. and max. height and width<br>
                  -Outline<br>
                  -Overflow<br>
                  -Padding<br>
                  -Position<br>
                  -Text-decoration<br>
                  -Vertical-align<br>
                  -Z-index<br>

              </div>
            </div>
            <p>In CSS we have what we call a selector. This defines what elements of the page a partiular style will apply to. You can use an HTML tag and that rule will apply to all that tag on the page.</p>
            <pre>
            (e.g. <b>p{

            }</b>)
            </pre>
            <p>Other way to do it is selecting elements by class. (e.g. <b>.description {<br>color: red;<br>}</b>)</p>
            <p>Codes can be complicated and very long, there's a way we can make it easy for the people who's going to be reading our code in the future. We can use <b>Code comments</b> (<em>Lines of text that computers ignores</em>).They are there so that programmers can leave notes for those other people (or themselves) to read.</p>
            <div class="Box sizing">
              <div class="box name"><b>Box sizing</b></div>
              <p>HTML are boxes and each box has four components. There are two techniques we can use to help deal with sizing issues:</p>
              <p>-Set sizes in terms of percent (%) rather than pixels.</p>
              <p>-Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="Box positioning">
              <div class="box name"><b>Box positioning</b></div>
              <p>Divs are blocks elements, so by default they take up the entire width of a page. Adding the rule <em>display-flex;</em> to the appropiate CSS will overrride this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.</p>

            <p>A <em>Computer</em> is a machine that can be programmed and this <em>program (computer program)</em> is a sequence of very precise steps that tell the computer what to do.</p>
            <p><b>Python</b> is a high level language that acts like an <em>interpreter</em> : It runs our programs, it interperts them, excutes the programs that we wrote in Python language by running a program in a language that the computer can understand directly. That way you are going to be able of running your program using your web browser.</p>
            <p>The reason why we needed to create specifics languages to tell computers what to do, and not recycling our own ancients language, is because our native languages are too <em>ambiguous</em> and requiere too many words and explanation to define things (<em>verbosity</em>) and the computers need to interpret exactly what the programmer says and for that reason the language has to do that in a precise amount of steps.</p>
            <p>The <em>Python grammar</em> is based in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form">Backus-Naur Form</a>.</p>
            <p>Non-terminal -- Replacement (<em>Derivation</em>)</p>
            <p>The code must match the correct grammar.</p>
            <p><b>Python grammar for arithmetic expressions</b></p>
            <p>-Expression.... Expression Operator Expression<br>
            -Expression.... Number<br>
            -Operator.... +, *, etc<br>
            -Number.... 0, 1, etc<br>
            -Expression.... (Expression)</p>

            <p><b>Variables</b></p>
            <p>In Python, a <em>variable</em> is an assigment statement (Name=Expression). We can use variables to create a name and use that name to reffer to a variable. Once we define a variable we can change the value, and when we use that name again, it reffers to the new value.</p>
            <p>The equal (=) sign does not have the same meaning in Python that in arithmetic. In Python it's equivalent to an assigment.</p>
            <p><b>Strings</b></p>
            <p>A <em>String</em> is a sequence of characters sorrounded by quotes. ("This is a String"). If you dont use the quotes, python interprets it as a variable, so you're going to get error, because it's not a define variable.</p> 
            <p><b>Functions</b></p>
            <p>A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. they are used to avoid repetition by grouping common operations.</p>
            <p>Functions can be break down in inputs, defined by def, and ouputs, stablished by return.</p>
            <p><b>Making decisions</b></p>
            <p>number-operator-number</p>
            <p>When we use "or", if the first expression evaluates to true, the second expression is not evaluated. If teh value of the first expression is false then the value "or" is the value of the second expresion.</p>
            <p><b>Loops</b></p>
            <p><em>Loops (While)</em> is what we use to do things over and over again. The block can run any number of times. It keeps going while the result is True.</p>
            <p><b>Lists</b></p>
            <p>The elements within a list can be anything we want. Wew can have characters, strings, numbers or even other list, and we are always going ti use comma to separated them.</p>
            <p><b>Mutation</b></p>
            <p>List support mutation. we can change the value of a list after we've created it.
            </p>
            <p><b>Aliasing</b></p>
            <p>In a list we could have two diferent ways to refer to the same object.</p>
            <p>In this unit we learn really important elements that can help us when programming using lists, the list operations are one of them, for example, append, plus, len, index, etc.</p>
            <p><b>Loops in list</b></p>
            <p>For loop:</p>
            <p>For each element in the list, we are going to assing that element to the name and evaluate the block in order, going through the list.</p>
            <p><b>How to solve problems</b></p>
            <p>A <em>Problem</em> is a set of inputs, and the relation betwen those inputs and the desired outputs</p>
            <p>The <em>Solution</em> is the procedure that can take any inputs of that set and produce output, a desire output that satisfies the relationship that we want.</p>
            <p><b>Steps to solve a problem</b></p>
            <p>1. What are the inputs?</p>
            <p>2. What are the ouputs?</p>
            <p>3. Work through some examples by hand</p>
            <p>4. Simple mechanical solution</p>
            <p>5. Don't optimize prematuraly (Keep it simple and correct)</p>
            <p>6. Develop solution in small steps we contest as we go.</p>
